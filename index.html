    <p><b>How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age</b> teaches in being
       a better person and better understanding other people, you are more likely to <i> “win
       friends and influence people”</i>. It teaches how to connect with people, be more likeabe
        and make meaningful relationships. This does not only relate to business or work but
        life in general. </p>
        <p>This book is an adaptation of the original book by <b>Dale Carnegie</b>, “How to Win Friends and
           Influence People”, written in 1936 at a time where there was no social media, email or
            mobile phones so communication was limited to face-to-face interactions, telephone and
             letters. Even so, the foundations of this book still matter to this day.</p>

<p>This book consists of 4 main parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#engagement">Essentials of Engagement</a></li>
      <li><a href="#six">Six Ways to Make a Lasting Impression</a></li>
      <li><a href="#merit">How to Merit and Maintain Others' Trust</a></li>
      <li><a href="#change">How to Lead Change Without Resistance or Resentment</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>Each part contains many principles and I chose a select few that I felt were most important.</p>

<h2 id="engagement">Essentials of Engagement</h2>
    <h4>Bury your Boomerangs</h4>
    <p>Whenever you feel the need to criticize, condemn or complain, don’t. This never achieves
      anything and you lose out on a chance to make a friend.</p>
      <h4>Affirm What’s Good</h4>
      <p>We are human and we make mistakes. Rather than putting someone down for making a mistake, we can help them to do better.</p>
        <h4>Connect with Core Desires</h4>
        <p>To connect with someone is to relate to them. Showing someone that you can benefit or interest them is the quickest way to make a friend.</p>
