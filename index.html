    <p><span class="friends">How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age</span> teaches in being
       a better person and better understanding other people, you are more likely to <i> “win
       friends and influence people”</i>. It teaches how to connect with people, be more likeabe
        and make meaningful relationships. This does not only relate to business or work but
        life in general. </p>
        <p>This book is an adaptation of the original book by <span class="bold">Dale Carnegie</span>, “How to Win Friends and
           Influence People”, written in 1936 at a time where there was no social media, email or
            mobile phones so communication was limited to face-to-face interactions, telephone and
             letters. Even so, the foundations of this book still matter to this day.</p>

<p>This book consists of 4 main parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="contents"><a href="#engagement">Essentials of Engagement</a></li>
      <li class="contents"><a href="#six">Six Ways to Make a Lasting Impression</a></li>
      <li class="contents"><a href="#merit">How to Merit and Maintain Others' Trust</a></li>
      <li class="contents"><a href="#change">How to Lead Change Without Resistance or Resentment</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>Each part contains many principles and I chose a select few that I felt were most important.</p>

<h2 id="engagement">Essentials of Engagement</h2>
<img id="cover" src="images/engagement.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133">
    <h4>Bury your Boomerangs</h4>

    <p>Whenever you feel the need to criticize, condemn or complain, don’t. This never achieves
      anything and you lose out on a chance to make a friend.</p>
      <h4>Affirm What’s Good</h4>
      <p>We are human and we make mistakes. Rather than putting someone down for making a mistake,
         we can help them to do better.</p>
        <h4>Connect with Core Desires</h4>
        <p>To connect with someone is to relate to them. Showing someone that you can benefit or
           interest them is the quickest way to make a friend.</p>

<h2 id="six">Six Ways to Make a Lasting Impression</h2>
<img class="image" src="images/Impression.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133">
<ol>
  <li>Take Interest in Others Interest:</li>
  <p>People gravitate towards people that show interest in them and things they like.</p>
  <li>Smile:</li>
  <p><i>“A smile costs nothing but it gives much”.</i></p>
  <li>Reign with Names:</li>
  <p>Carnegie puts emphasis on names being the most important part of forming a relationship
  with a person.</p>
  <li>Listen Longer</li>
  <p>People love to be heard. Take time to listen to what others have to say.</p>
  <li>Discuss what matters to them:</li>
  <p>When it comes to mattering to others, you must discuss what matters to them.
    Otherwise they'll simply stop listening.</p>
 <li>Leave Others a Little Better</li>
<p>We've been taught to always look at the bigger picture. <span class="bold">Big goals, big connections and big deals.</span>
But in doing so we look past the small things that matter the most. How we treat people and how we affect them.
Always remember to leave a lasting impression on someone.</p>
</ol>

<h2 id="merit">How to Merit and Maintain Others's Trust</h2>
<img class="image" src="images/trust.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133">

<ul>
<li>Avoid Arguments</li>
<p> <span class="italic">"Arguing with another person will rarely get you anywhere; they usually end
  with each person more firmly convinced of his rightness. You may be right,
  dead right, but arguing is just as futile as if you were dead wrong."</span></p>
<li>Never say "You're wrong"</li>
<li>Begin in a friendly way</li>
</ul>
